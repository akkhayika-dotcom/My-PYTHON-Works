# 🐍 My Python Projects

Hi! I am a 3rd Semester Computer Science student. This repository is a collection of Python projects I built to practice my coding logic and understand how software works.

I focused on learning how to split code into different files (modules) and how to save data permanently using JSON.

## 📂 Project List

### 1. 🎓 Student Management System
* **What it does:** Allows users to add, view, update, and delete student marks and details.
* **Key Learning:** I learned how to use **JSON files** so that the student data is saved even after I close the program.
* **Tech Used:** Python, JSON, Lists, Dictionaries.

### 2. 💳 ATM Simulator
* **What it does:** A simulation of an ATM where you can deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
* **Key Learning:** I wrote this using **Modular Programming**. Instead of one big file, I split the logic into `withdraw.py`, `deposit.py`, `check_balance.py`,and `atm.py` to keep the code clean.
* **Tech Used:** Python Functions, Import Module.

### 3. 📚 Library Tool
* **What it does:** A simple tool to track books in a library.
* **Key Learning:** Practiced using Python loops and error handling to ensure the program doesn't crash if the user enters the wrong input.

### 4. 🧮 Scientific Calculator
* **What it does:** Performs math operations like power, modulus, and division.
* **Key Learning:** I created my own custom Python modules and imported them into the main file.

### 5. 🎮 Python Games
* **Projects:** Magic 8-Ball, Number Guessing, Rock-Paper-Scissors.
* **Why I made them:** To practice logic (using `if/else` conditions) and probability (using the `random` module).
